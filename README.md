# Instruction Serialiser

This repository contains implementations of a library targeting the serialisation
and deserialisation of arithmetic and logical instructions in a uniform format in
several programming languages. It makes use of
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) to define the
available data structures. You can find the definitions in the
[definition](definition) directory in this repository. The language specific
implementations can be found in the directories named after the respective
language.
